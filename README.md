## Understanding SHA256 Hash

A fingerprint is an identifier of a person. SHA256 Hash is similar to this for the identity of digital documents. 
"SHA" stands for "Secure Hash Algorithm" and 256 is the number of bits in memory. It's a hexadecimal hash. 
64 characters.

5 requirements for Hash algorithms:

* One-way -> cannot restore document from hash
* Deterministic -> same document will generate exact same result
* Fast computation
* Avalanche effect -> any change (no matter how tiny) will totally change the hash
* Must withstand collisions -> can't recreate / forge
